          <p>I've been a freelancer in Derby for six years and I enjoy attending local meet-ups and socialising with fellow creatives and freelancers. I was inspired by the <a href="http://oxfreelancers.com/" title="freelancers in Oxfordshire">Oxford Freelancers</a> website and wanted to create a space that helped match the right freelancer with the right project in my area. I believe there's plenty of work to go around and we should be supportive of each other! Hopefully, this list will help, if like me, you're often asked for recommendations of other freelancers or even need to hire someone else for one of your own projects.</p>

          <p>I'm based in Derby but it has quite a small community, as does places like Loughborough so I thought it would be ideal to include the whole of the East Midlands so places like Derby, Northampton and Loughborough could unite with Leicester and Nottingham to form a large community.</p>
