### Thanks

This project was originally created by [Mariana Mota Morris](http://www.marianamota.com/) and [James Morris](http://jimmymorris.co.uk/) who were kind enough to let me fork it from [marianamota/oxfordfreelancers](https://github.com/marianamota/oxfordfreelancers). The original website, [Oxford Freelancers](http://oxfreelancers.com/), powers a list of freelancers in Oxford and there is also a community for [Birmingham](http://freelancers.birmingham.io/), which has inspired this Jekyll fork.

### Want to make changes?

The project is open to forking and pull requests, visit the [official repository](katherinecory/eastmidlandsfreelancers) for more information.

This fork uses [Jeykll](http://jekyllrb.com/) to share the layout between the pages. If you have [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) installed, you can get your own version running locally by running these commands.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:katherinecory/eastmidlandsfreelancers.git
cd eastmidlandsfreelancers
jekyll serve
```

Providing that worked, you should now be able to preview your changes here: [http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/)
